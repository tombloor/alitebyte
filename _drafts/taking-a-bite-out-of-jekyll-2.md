This series is focused on documenting my journey in setting up a blog using `Jekyll`. 

In this part we will look at using `Bootstrap` to quickly set up an extremely minimalist theme for our blog.

In the last part we went about setting up a simple `Jekyll` site and publishing it locally so that we could view it in the browser. Now I think we should start on customising the appearance of our blog so that we're not just using the default out of the box theme. For my blog I want this to be a gradual process as I don't have a solid idea of what I want the end result to be yet, so we're going to start here by making an incredibly minimalist theme that we can add to and modify in the future.

I would like to think that by the time you're reading this I will have managed to make considerable progress on this theme, so I'll include some pictures below to show you what we're aiming for by the end of this post.

Now that we know what we're aiming for, let's get started.
