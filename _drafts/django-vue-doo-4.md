This will be a short series looking at setting up a simple ToDo list web application using a `Django Rest Framework` backend with a `Vue.js` user interface. Full source code will be available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tombloor){:target='_blank'} once the series has finished.

In this part of this series we will be setting up our login page and making some requests to our `django` api.
