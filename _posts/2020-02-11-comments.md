I did a thing, and I think it's pretty cool!

## The thing I did

If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you should be able to notice what I did.

It's been on my todo list since day one and I finally got around to figuring out a comments system. I was originally planning to use something like [Staticman](https://staticman.net/){:target="_blank"}, but I had issues getting it set up and just gave up after a while. Instead I decided to roll my own solution and while I still have ideas for improvements that I will want to implement eventually, it's finally ready to be released into the wild.

For now, this post is just to announce this thing that I did, and to encourage anyone reading to leave me a comment.

You can look at the code for my implementation on [Github](https://github.com/tombloor/jekyll-comments){:target="_blank"}. I'll be writing up an explaination of how it works in a future post, so keep an eye out for that. I promise I won't disappear for as long as I did last time...maybe.
