In this series I will be working through the `bandit` challenges on [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/){:target="_blank"} - A site offering `CTF` style wargames.

This post will contain a walkthrough for challenge 4.

## Bandit 4

Let's get started with bandit level 4, ssh into the challenge as normal and enter the password from level 3.

```sh
tom@alitebyte:~# ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

In this challenge we are told that the solution is in the only human-readable file in the `inhere` directory. Now you could sit there and `cat` each file in that directory until you find the right one, but that's not going to cut it when dealing with more than just a handful of files.

The `file` command will attempt to figure out the type of whatever file we point it at. For example, if we pass the first file in the `inhere` directory to the `file` command:

```sh
bandit4@bandit:~$ file inhere/-file00
inhere/-file00: data
```

So now we just have to run the `file` command against all the files we're interested in and see which one returns a human-readable format.

```sh
bandit4@bandit:~$ file inhere/*
inhere/-file00: data
inhere/-file01: data
inhere/-file02: data
inhere/-file03: data
inhere/-file04: data
inhere/-file05: data
inhere/-file06: data
inhere/-file07: ASCII text
inhere/-file08: data
inhere/-file09: data
```

Looking at the results it's pretty obvious which file we're interested in, so the only thing left to do is `cat` it for the solution.

```sh
bandit4@bandit:~$ cat inhere/-file07
```

Check back again soon for challenge 5.
