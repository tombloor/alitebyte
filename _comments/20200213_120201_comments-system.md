This is a test. Apparently I have some more characters to use up, so here I am, using it up. I'm not sure what else to say. This is pretty cool. I like this feature but the color scheme is off. Why is it purple? Why purple, right? Looks like Barney barfed all over the place. Or a grape died. One of the two. Or maybe some more. It could be more, but it could be less too. That's just the way life is.

I am feeling very philosophical right now. But I will end it as I ran out of thoughts for another 477 characters. Cheerio
