A small Flask application to create comments for a Jekyll sites.

Comments can be created by submitting a POST request to the service.
These comments can then either be created as a physical file, or
as a pull request in GitHub when allows an element of moderation before
they are added to the site's source files.

To see this project in action you can try leaving a comment on any of my posts.
