I thought of this project while I was trying to think of something small to 
start learning Vue.js.

Inspired by a minigame from
[Sid Meier's Covert Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Covert_Action){:target='_blank'},
Quote Breaker is a simple browser game where you must decode a famous quote that
has been scrambled. I used this project to introduce myself to the Vue.js framework
and I intend to expand on it while I continue learning.
